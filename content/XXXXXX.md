### Currently a PhD student in Epidemiology in National School of Public Health/Fiocruz

Please note that this is a *real* resume, and I'm really looking for a PhD
student position at the moment. I made this resume because Yihui asked me
if I'd like to test the **pagedown** package with my resume. If you are
interested in my background and skills, please feel free to contact me.
